## What is this?

This repository holds the online pages of the course on Machine Learning in Particle Physics.

It is designed for the Master's program of the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://nexteinstein.org).

The course uses [Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) as a wrapper for displaying lecture content and exercises.

Programming tutorials and assignments will be done in Python using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
