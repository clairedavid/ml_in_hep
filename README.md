# Machine Learning in Particle Physics

:warning: **This is the old repository (2022-2023)**: please go to Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is this?

This repository holds the online pages of the course on Machine Learning in Particle Physics.

It is designed for the Master's program of the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS)](https://nexteinstein.org).

The course uses [Jupyter-Book](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html) as a wrapper for displaying lecture content and exercises.

Programming tutorials and assignments will be done in Python using [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

## Calendar

This course will be delivered at AIMS Senegal in January 2023 and AIMS South Africa in February 2023.
