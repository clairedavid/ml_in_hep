# JupyterHub for class

&nbsp;  

For in-class exercises and tutorials we will be using Jupyter notebooks, an interactive web-based interface combining narrative text and live code you can tweak and run yourself.

The backend to streamline this is called a JupyterHub, a multi-user server designed to support many users by managing singular Jupyter Notebook servers.

The exercises and programming practice for this course will be done on [Colaboratory](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html), Google's online front end interface from its cloud. Datasets on GDrive can be accessed via a Jupyter Notebook on Colab.
