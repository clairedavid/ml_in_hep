# JupyterHub for class

For in-class exercises and tutorials we will be using Jupyter notebooks, an interactive web-based interface combining narrative text and live code you can tweak and run yourself.

The backend to streamline this is called a JupyterHub, a multi-user server designed to support many users by managing singular Jupyter Notebook servers.

For this course a JupyterHub instance is created with the necessary environment pre-installed.
