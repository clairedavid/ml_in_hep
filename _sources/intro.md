Learn the math behind machine learning!

Learn how to code a machine learning algorithm by hand in python.

Learn how to diagnose and assess the performance of your algorithm.

Learn how to use the most advanced libraries for best optimization results!

```{important}
The examples will be taken from particle physics, but no prerequisites are necessary.

It is a math course with some fun programming practice to enhance your coding skills.
```

```{note}
The covered topics can be seen on the left menu, which also indicates the tentative schedule for the three weeks.
