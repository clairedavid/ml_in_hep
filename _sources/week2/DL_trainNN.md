# Let's train our NN!

Time to gather all the notions covered in this lecture and learn how to build a deep learning model.

## Deep Learning Model Life-Cycle
Designing a machine learning algorithm has a particular workflow, usually called life-cycle (but workflow would be more accurate here). 

The five steps are:

1. Prepare the Data
1. Choose the Model
1. Train the Model
1. Evaluate the Model
1. Make Predictions

These steps may be coinced in a different way in industry, with e.g. the last one called "deployment". We will stay in the academic realm with prediction making, as this is all that is about.

## What is PyTorch?
We could compute a big neural network from scratch in python, declaring all the functions, classes etc... That would be very tedious and likely not computationally optimized for speed. Most importantly: it's been already done. There are indeed dedicated libraries for designing and developing neural networks and deep learning technology. 

Keras and PyTorch are two of the most powerful open-source machine learning frameworks used in both academia and industry. 



PyTorch is an open-source Python library for deep learning developed and maintained by Facebook.
