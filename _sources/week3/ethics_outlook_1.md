# Ethics in ML

## About this lecture

### You are part of it!
This lecture will be delivered as a flipped-classroom. 

```{admonition} What is a flipped-classroom?
:class: note
A flipped-classroom is a pedagogical strategy consisting of reversing the traditional teaching scheme: instead of learning in class and practising at home, students are given material to study themselves beforehand and the in-class time is dedicated for debates, discussions and problem solving.
This approach gives more autonomy to the students, enhances self-learning skills and promotes active participation and expression.

If you are curious and want to learn more, the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) gives a good overview and describes some [examples of flipped-classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom#Examples) by field of study.

```

You will be asked to read some of the online articles listed in the Section {ref}`ethics:readingmaterial` below. During the class we will focus on discussions and debates about each case study. Then we will extract the key terms and synthetize together to reach conclusive remarks about ethics in machine learning.

The lecture will end with a graded short essay. 

More information is given in the following section.

### Schedule

__Part One: What is ethics? What is ethics in machine learning?__  
At home, you will think of a definition of "ethics in machine learning" in __your own words__. We will start the lecture by sharing our findings and will agree on a definition together.  

__Part Two: Case Study__  
In groups, you will discuss a given case study according to the points provided in the Section {ref}`ethics:guidance` below. 

__Part Three: Presentations__  
Each group will present the outcomes of their discussion on the case study in an oral presentation.

__Part Four: Synthesis__  
As a class, we will extract together the key elements from the case studies and use them to draw conclusive remarks.

__Part Five: Essay (graded)__  
After a deserved break, you will be presented three questions dealing with ethics in machine learning. Choose the one you prefer and write a short essay of minimum 300 words. In your essay you should clearly articulate your answer, bring a nuanced argumentation considering the different perspectives and illustrate as much as possible your arguments with examples.

## Reading Material
There is no reading material for part one (definition exercise) yet some hints. Wikipedia is also a good place to start. The UN agency UNESCO has written on the topic.

For the case studies: read at least the material for one. But if you have time, try to read another case study.

```{admonition} Bring Your Own Case Study
:class: tip
If you are already captivated by a tool employing machine learning and are curious to explore its ethical aspects and implications, contact the instructor as soon as possible (before the third week). If there is enough interest to form a group, an additional case study could be added to the debate.

```{warning}
It is crucial for you to have absorbed the material before the course. Make sure you have done so in advance to arrive in class prepared for the discussions.

(ethics:guidance)=
## Guidance
These questions will help you extract the important information from the material and anticipate the discussion.

* What are the different agents/actors? (think of professions and also societal entities)
* How impartial can instances such as companies or organizations be?

A recommended framework to analyse each case study would be a table with:
* the type(s) of machine learning implementation(s) and/or algorithms
* the domain(s) (medical, language, internet, data science)
* the recipients/beneficiaries
* the good: how is it beneficial for the recipients/users
* the harms: what are the ethical issues?
* the solutions: how to tackle and address those issues?
