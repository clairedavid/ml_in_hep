I am an experimental particle physicist, and as such I study the Universe through its tiniest, most fundamental constituents: the elementary particles. I am involved in two international collaborations: the [ATLAS Experiment](https://atlas.cern/), which is one of the detectors of the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at [CERN](https://home.web.cern.ch/), and the [Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE)](https://www.dunescience.org/), which is a future detector to be hosted by the US laboratory [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/) near Chicago, Illinois.

I was initially trained as an engineer at the [Institut National des Sciences Appliquées (INSA)](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/en/index.html) in Toulouse, France.

I switched to fundamental science with a PhD in Particle Physics at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/science/physics/index.php) in Canada. I was based at [TRIUMF](https://www.triumf.ca/) in Vancouver and was stationned from 2012 until mid-2013 at CERN between Switzerland and France.


After a postdoctoral fellowship at [DESY](https://www.desy.de/) in Hamburg, Germany, I started as Assistant Professor at [York University](https://www.yorku.ca/science/physics/), north of Toronto, Canada.

## Schedule

### Upcoming 

This course is being taught at AIMS Senegal from January 9 until January 27, 2023.

It will be taught at AIMS South Africa from January 30 until February 17, 2023.


### Previous version

I taught a mini-version of this course at the [African School of Physics (ASP2022)](https://www.africanschoolofphysics.org/asp2022/) in Gqebera, South Africa on [December 9](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1210872/timetable/#20221209).


## Acknowledgments

I have received the precious help of colleagues and friends. A big thank you to Harrison Prosper for being a great mentor and sharing valuable resources.
I would also like to thank Alex Held, Benjamin Nachman, Clara Nellist, Matthew Feickert, Sascha Caron and Will Leight.

For this course I got inspired by Coursera's Introduction to Machine Learning, by Andrew Ng. I found wonderful tutorials in Machine Learning Mastery, by Dr. Jason Brownlee. Aurélien Géron's book Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow ([Second Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/)) is fabulous. I am grateful to all 'StackOverflowers' helping me debug some parts of code to shape the tutorials and assignments into, I hope, an awesome learning experience for the students.
