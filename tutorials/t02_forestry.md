<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>Higgs boson production modes</h3>

In particle physics, the Higgs boson plays an essential role, in particular (pun intended) it gives massive particles their observed mass. The Higgs boson can be produced in different ways - we call this "Higgs boson production mechanism." The main two production processes are: 
* gluon-gluon Fusion (ggF): two gluons, one from each of the incoming LHC protons, interact or “fuse” to create a Higgs boson.
* Vector Boson Fusion (VBF): a quark from each of the incoming LHC protons radiates off a heavy vector boson ($W$ or $Z$). These bosons interact or “fuse” to produce a Higgs boson.

```

The latter process, VBF, is very interesting to study as it probes the coupling between the Higgs boson and the two other vector bosons. This is seen on the Feynman diagram with the vertex between the two departing wavy branches of each vector boson V and the dashed line H representing the Higgs boson. Such configuration is said to be "sensitive to new physics", because there can be processes that are not part of the current theory, the Standard Model, arising there. Hence the importance to measure the rates of VBF collisions (how frequent does it happen). But before, how to select the Higgs boson VBF production from the other one, gluon-gluon Fusion?

<h3>Inside the Data</h3>  

````{margin}
Curious about CERN ATLAS Open Data initiative? Explore it more [here](https://atlas.cern/Resources/Opendata).
````
This tutorial will use ATLAS Open Data, which provides open access to proton-proton collision data at the LHC for educational purposes. 
 
In the VBF process, the initial quarks that first radiated the vector bosons are deflected only slightly and travel roughly along their initial directions. They are then detected as particle "jets" in the different hemispheres of the detector. Jets are reconstructed as objects. Although they are more of a conical shape, they are stored in the data as a four-vector entity, with a norm, two angles and an energy. 

The collisions have been filtered to select those containing each a Higgs boson, four leptons and at least two jets. 

We will focus on two variable for now: 
* $|\Delta\eta_{jj}|$: it corresponds to the angle between the two jets ($\eta$ is the pseudorapidity)
*   $m_{jj}$:   the invariant mass of the two jets
 
These variable are already calculated in the data samples.

## Explore the Data
### Get the Data 
The datasets can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1b_GDA2bfsUhlvzX-A7RjHoHCL5Z8-bkb?usp=sharing). Download the files and put them in your GDrive.

To load the data on Google Colab, you will need to run a cell with these lines:
```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
```
Then using `!ls` you can get the path where the data files are located.

Before playing with the data, let's import libraries.

```python
import os, sys
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# set a seed to ensure reproducibility
seed = 42
rnd  = np.random.RandomState(seed)

# Matplotlib plotting settings
import matplotlib as mp
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
print('matplotlib version: {}'.format(mp.__version__))

FONTSIZE = 16
params = {
         'axes.labelsize': FONTSIZE,
         'axes.titlesize': FONTSIZE,
         'xtick.labelsize':FONTSIZE,
         'ytick.labelsize':FONTSIZE}
plt.rcParams.update(params)
```
__Question 1.0: Get the data__  
Use `pd.read_csv` to store each dataset into a dataframe. Name them `train`, `valid` and `test` respectively. 
Explore the variables by printing the first five rows.

The `sample` column stores the labels of the collisions: +1 corresponds to VFB and -1 to ggF.

__Question 1.1: Inspect the data. How many events (rows) does each file contain?__  
__Question 1.2: How many events of each process (VFB and ggF) does each file contain?__  

Ask for hint(s) to the instructor if you are stuck.

### Visualize the Data
Let's draw a scatter plot to see how the data look like! But first, we will create reduced dataset with only the necessary variables. Copy the following in your notebook:
```python
# GLOBAL VARIABLES
XNAME = 'detajj'; XLABEL = r'$|\Delta\eta_{jj}|$'
YNAME = 'massjj'; YLABEL = r'$m_{jj}$ (GeV)'

inputs= [XNAME, YNAME] ;

XBINS = 5 ; XMIN = 0 ; XMAX = 5    ; XSTEP = 1
YBINS = 5 ; YMIN = 0 ; YMAX = 1000 ; YSTEP = 200

# Creating reduced datasets with detajj & massjj only
X_train = train[inputs] ; y_train = train['sample']
X_valid = valid[inputs] ; y_valid = valid['sample']
X_test  =  test[inputs] ; y_test  =  test['sample']
```
The plotting macro is given, but you will have to modify it later:
```python
def plot_scatter(sig, bkg, 
              xname=XNAME, xlabel=XLABEL, xmin=XMIN, xmax=XMAX, xstep=XSTEP,
              yname=YNAME, ylabel=YLABEL, ymin=YMIN, ymax=YMAX, ystep=YSTEP,
              fgsize=(6, 6), ftsize=FONTSIZE, alpha=0.3, title="Scatter plot"):
  
  fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=fgsize)

  # Annotate x-axis
  ax.set_xlim(xmin, xmax)
  ax.set_xlabel(xlabel)
  ax.set_xticks(np.arange(xmin, xmax+xstep, xstep))

  # Annotate y-axis
  ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)
  ax.set_ylabel(ylabel)
  ax.set_yticks(np.arange(ymin, ymax+ystep, ystep))

  # Scatter signal and background:
  ax.scatter(sig[xname], sig[yname], marker='o', s=15, c='b', alpha=alpha, label='VBF')
  ax.scatter(bkg[xname], bkg[yname], marker='*', s= 5, c='r', alpha=alpha, label='ggf')

  # Legend and plot:
  ax.legend(fontsize=ftsize, bbox_to_anchor=(1.04, 0.5), loc="center left", frameon=False) 
  ax.set_title(title, pad=20)
  plt.show()
```

__Question 1.3: Make a scatter plot of the training data__ , with $|\Delta\eta_{jj}|$ on the $x$-axis and $m_{jj}$ on the $y$-axis. You will have to split the data sample in signal (VBF) and background (ggF).

## Decision Tree
Let's use Scikit-Learn to make a first shallow decision tree.

```python
from sklearn import tree
from sklearn.tree import export_text
```
__Question 2.1: Make a decision tree with a maximum depth of 2.__  
__Question 2.2: Plot the tree using `tree.plot_tree` command, with the `filled` option activated.__  

You will see something like this:


```{figure} ../images/tuto_02_2_shallowtree.png
---
  name: tuto_02_2_shallowtree
  width: 80%
---
 .  Representation of the Decision Tree.  
 <sub>Image: from Scikit-Learn `tree` library</sub>
```
__Question 2.3: Comment the tree.__  
Describe what is the representation. How are the variables encoded in Scikit-Learn? Which direction (left/right) is true/false? What are the nodes' colouring meaning? Where goes the signal, where goes the background? Which leaves are the purest? For which category?

__Question 2.4: Calculate the accuracy from the numbers displayed in the leaves.__  
Detail your calculations.


## Performance metrics
We will compute some metrics by hand and compare with Scikit-Learn predefined methods. As a start, the Confusion Matrix from Scikit-Learn will help us. Let's first import the library:
```python
from sklearn import metrics
```

The way the confusion matrix is called is:
```
cm = metrics.confusion_matrix(y_obs, y_preds)
disp = metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm)
disp.plot()
plt.show()
```
__Questions 3.1: Confusion Matrix__  
Using the `predict()` method on your classifier, write the code to show the confusion matrix.

__Question 3.2: Comment it__  
How is the confusion matrix encoded in Scikit-Learn? Is it the same as in the lecture? Find and explain in which cells are the True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positive (FP) and False Negatives (FN). 

__Question 3.3: Function to print metrics and compare with Scikit-Learn__  
````{margin}
```{tip}
The confusion matrix `cm` is a 2 $\times$ 2 array. Thus the content of the first cell can be accessed via `cm[0,0]`. 
```
````
You will write a function `print_metrics` that extract the TP, TN, FP, FN from the confusion matrix. It should then print:
* The accuracy
* The True Positive Rate (TPR)
* The True Negative Rate (TNR)
* The False Positive Rate (FPR)

A skeleton is provided below. Complete it according to the instructions above. Choose the proper labels for `LABEL1` and `LABEL2` at the end of the provided code.
```python
def print_metrics(clf, X, y_obs, printCM=False, title="Classifier Performance"):
    
    #____________________

    # Your code here

    #____________________

    print(f"\n{title}\n")
    print(f"Accuracy: {acc:.3f}")
    print(f"     TPR: {TPR:.3f}")
    print(f"     TNR: {TNR:.3f}")
    print(f"     FPR: {FPR:.3f}")
    
    # Check Scikit-Learn (SL)
    acc_SL = metrics.accuracy_score(y_obs, y_preds)
    TPR_SL = metrics.recall_score(y_obs, y_preds)
    print(f"Check: Scikit-Learn accuracy: {acc_SL:.3f} \t Recall (TPR): {TPR_SL:.3f}")   

    if printCM:
        disp = metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay(confusion_matrix=cm, display_labels=['LABEL1', 'LABEL2'])
        disp.plot()
        plt.show()
```

Call your function with the train and test datasets (change the title accordingly).

__Question 3.4: Which error type is the highest?__  


## ROC The Tree
Let's use Scikit-Learn `metrics` to get the ingredients to plot a ROC curve. We need continuous probabilities.  How are probabilities calculated? Let's show the first 5 entries of `X_train`. Recall the decision tree (Figure {numref}`tuto_02_2_shallowtree`) we plotted above.
```python
X_train[:5]
```

The probability is defined as "the fraction of samples of the same class in a leaf". (source: [Scikit-Learn predict_proba function](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/f3f51f9b6/sklearn/tree/_classes.py#L977)). 

__Q 4.1: What are the signal probabilities for the first five entries?__  
_Hint: first, find for each event in which leaf it falls according to the input values._

__Q 4.2: Check your answers with `predict_proba` and explain the output array__  
```python
y_scores_train = clf.predict_proba(X_train)
y_scores_train[:5]
```

<h3>ROC Curve</h3>  
Below is a macro to plot the ROC curve. You will have to complete it on your notebook. Look in the documentation of Scikit-Learn to see which function to call and how to use it.  

_Note: The `classindex` is the index of the positive class on the score array (first position is index 0, second is 1, etc)._

```python
def plot_ROC_curve(clf, label_leg, X, y_obs, class_index):
  
  fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6,6))

  # Luck line
  ax.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], color="navy", lw=2, linestyle="--")

  # Get proba predictions:
  y_scores = clf.predict_proba(X)

  # Getting the ROC curve values
  fpr = dict() ; tpr = dict()

  #_____________________________

  # Your code here (2 lines)

  #_____________________________

  ax.set_xlim([0, 1]) ; ax.set_ylim([0, 1])
  ax.grid(color='grey', linestyle='--', linewidth=1)
  ax.set_xlabel("False Positive Rate")
  ax.set_ylabel("True Positive Rate")
  ax.set_title("ROC Trees", pad=20)

  # Legend and plot:
  ax.legend(fontsize=FONTSIZE, bbox_to_anchor=(1.04, 0.5), loc="center left", frameon=False) 
  plt.show()
```
Call the function with your classifier. For the legend you can write "Decision Tree Depth 2" (we will increase the depth soon).

Let's now make a decision tree very deep, of depth 20. Create a new classifier:

```python
tree_clf_depth20 = tree.DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth = 20 )
tree_clf_depth20.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Use your function `print_metrics` to see the performance and plot its ROC curve.

__Q 4.3: How does the performance of this tree compare with the shallow tree of depth 2? What is likely to happen here?__  


## Decision Surface
We can create a decision surface for a given classifier with two inputs. It is a representation of all the cuts done on the variables. For this, once we have trained a model, we use it to make predictions for a grid of values across the input domain. Here is the function to compute the values:


```python
def get_decision_surface_xyz(clf, inputs, x_lims, y_lims, step):
  
  # Create all of the lines and rows of the grid
  xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(x_lims[0], x_lims[1]+step, step),
                         np.arange(y_lims[0], y_lims[1], step))
  
  # Creat dataframe with flattened (ravel) vectors:
  X = pd.DataFrame({inputs[0]: xx.ravel(), inputs[1]: yy.ravel()})

  # Get Z value vectors (ravel = flatten grid in vector)
  Z = clf.predict(X)

  # Reshape Z as grid for exporting 
  zz = Z.reshape(xx.shape)

  # Return grid + surface values:
  return (xx, yy, zz)
```
__Q 5.1: Draw the Decision Surface__  
First, add the code above in a new cell. Then, modify the `plot_scatter` function with these two additions:
* add an optional argument `ds=None`
* add before the legend the following:
````{margin}
```{warning}
Make sure you keep the correct indentation!
```
````
```python
  # Decision surface
  if ds:
    (xx, yy, Z) = ds
    cs = plt.contourf(xx, yy, Z, colors=['red','blue'], alpha=0.3)
```
````{margin}
```{warning}
My first classifier was called `tree_clf_depth2`. Make sure you adapt your code with the relevant variable you declared for your first classifier.
```
````
Call your function with your first classifier.
```python
# Get values x,y,z of decision surface for classifier:
DS_xyz = get_decision_surface_xyz(tree_clf_depth2, inputs, [XMIN, XMAX], [YMIN, YMAX], 0.05)
# Plot scatter with decision surface:
plot_scatter(sig, bkg, DS_xyz, title="Decision Surface for DT Depth 2")
```

Call it again with the tree of depth 20.  

___Q 5.2: Comment on the decision surface with the deep tree: what is happening? How to cope?__  


## The Forest
Let's plant a forest now. We need the following imports:
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from pprint import pprint # 'pretty printing', for listing the parameters
```
__Q 6.1: Create a random forest with 100 estimators__
