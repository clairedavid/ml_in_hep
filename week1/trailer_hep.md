# From detectors to publications

How do we gain knowledge about the Universe in experimental particle physics?

This question intrigued me so much that it got me to leave engineering and start a Ph.D. in fundamental physics.

```{note}
Experimental particle physics is the __context__ of this machine learning course, from which examples will be taken.

This section is not a physics lecture, rather an introductory tour in the subatomic world. It aims at:
* expanding your knowledge in a new area of mathematical sciences
* showing how much maths and computing is behind the discipline 
* presenting the ongoing research and opportunities to work in the field

## What is particle physics?
The goal of physics is to understand the universe. Quite a task. Among the numerous branches of physics, particle physics focuses on the tiniest chuncks of matter: elementary particles. 
It describes how the known elementary particles interact through three of the four fundamental forces, or interactions: electromagnetism, weak interaction and strong interactions. 
What about gravity? The great Albert Einstein tried to include it until his death without success; merging the theories of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity is still one of the hardest physics problem today.

So you got the spoiler alert: the theory of particle physics, bearing the weird name of "Standard Model," is not complete as it does not include all fundamental interactions.
Despite this important caveat, the model is a triumphant achievement made by many great physicists since the 1950s (with a large fraction becoming Physics Nobel Prize laureates).
Not only the theoretial framework accurately describes the known subatomic world, it has accumulated remarkable successes with numerous predictions verified in experiments at an incredible level of precision.

### Theoretical vs experimental particle physics
In all physical sciences, knowledge is forged via the process known as the scientific method.

```{admonition} In-class exercise
:class: dropdown
Take 5 min to define the scientific method. Write full sentences or keywords in a bullet list.
Then compare with your neighbours your definition.
What notion(s) did you put that they omitted? What did you miss?
Form a merged definition with two or three classmates.

In particle physics there has always been a back-and-forth between theory and experiments.
Either a new particle is discovered and no one understand why. It was the case in 1936 with the discovery of the muon, a heavier cousin of the electron. It surprised the
community so much that Nobel laureate Isaac Rabi famously quipped: "Who ordered that?" The other way around is more common: the model provides a prediction, usually in the form of a new particle or a new process (particle interaction) that can be observed in the data from particle detectors. The theory of particle physics has drawn its succcess from the numerous experimental confirmations of theoretical predictions, with mind-blowing precision at the part-per-billion level. 

### State-of-the-art machines 
Often a conceptualized new particle would require several decades for the experimental setup to be ready, as its observation demands a higher energy beam, a finer resolution or both. In that sense, particle physicists works hand-in-hand with engineers towards pushing the limits of technology. In the case of the Higgs boson, a missing piece in the Standard Model responsible of giving to other particles their respective masses, it took 48 years between its formulation in 1964 and the discovery in 2012 at the [Large Hadron Collider (LHC)](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at the European Organization for Nuclear Research near Geneva, Switzerland. The LHC is one of the most complex machines ever built by human beings and collect several [superlatives](https://home.cern/resources/faqs/facts-and-figures-about-lhc). I happen to work on another endeavour, currently under construction, called the [Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE)](https://www.dunescience.org/). It will demands a newer generation of detectors due to the size and the intensity of the incoming beam. Unique challenges lie aheaed for this future complex of detector (including the future biggest neutrino detector), especially in computing. Due to enormous physical data volumes that needs to be acquired, stored and analyzed, the requirements of DUNE is likely to trigger a paradigm shift with groundbreaking techniques.

### Many activities, many people 
Particle physics is a discipline offering a wide range of sub-activities, in particular on the experimental side. On the data analysis side, the numerous steps and various associated tasks will be covered in the coming section {ref}`trailer:hep:howAna`. It is also possible to contribute in hardware projects, such as test beam campaigns and detector upgrade programs. Getting to design, test or build the next generation of particle detectors can be very exciting! Many simulations are required, so even on this hardware/engineering side, mathematicians and programmers can help.

Nowadays, most particle physics endeavours can not be achieved alone. The magnitude of the experiments, their complexity and the resulting workload require a highly collaborative and international environment. For instance the ATLAS Collaboration, associated with the largest general-purpose particle detector experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), comprises over 5900 physicists, engineers, technicians, students and administrators. ATLAS has 2900 scientific authors from over 180 institutions. It is one of the largest collaborative efforts ever attempted in science. The more recent DUNE Collaboration has already 1400 members and is growing.

### Spin-offs
In the quest to better understand the universe, particle physics has created by-products and even new disciplines, some drastically changing our lives. One striking example is the World Wide Web, invented at CERN by computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. At the start, the so-called HTTP protocol and first web server were a mean to manage documentation. A couple of years later, this seamless network that any computer would be able to access revolutionized the way information was shared and the way we communicate, socialize, and conduct business.

## The maths in particle physics
Although the field belongs to physics, a lot of mathematic can be found in many aspects while exploring the subatomic world.

### Symmetries, groups and 
The Standard Model is a quantum field theory that is based on the gauge symmetry. Let's unwrap this sentence.





_Lagrangian - principle of least action - symmetries as 'invariance' Noether theorem - gauge theory - abelian groups_
_The universe we live in is a particular of gauge symmetry_ I find it mind-blowing that not-only reality 


## Particle physics and computing


### Monte Carlo generators
In HEP, sophisticated simulation programmes are used to design the experimental set-ups and to interpret the data.
