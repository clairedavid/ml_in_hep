# 2. Warm up: Linear Regression



The mathematics of machine learning are introduced through a simple situation that may be already familiar: 'fitting a straight line'.  

Through this exercise we will define the notation that we will keep throughout the course. The concepts of feature scaling and learning rate will be presented. Finally we will spend time on the gradient descent, an iterative procedure at the core of many machine learning algorithms.
