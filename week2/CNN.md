# 9. Convolutional Neural Networks

## CNNs in less than 100 words

Convolutional Neural Networks are specific artificial networks reigning supreme in image processing tasks such as image classification, object detection and image generation.

Applications of CNNs are not restricted to image inputs: they are used with audio data for voice recognition, as well as text data in the field of Natural Language Processing (a collection of techniques and approaches that are used to analyze and understand natural language data).
````
CNNs contain special layers that take into account the spatial relationships between pixels, thus preserving the spatial structure in an image data. CNNs work by applying a series of filters to the input image to extract relevant features, such as edges, shapes, and textures, and then using these features to make predictions or take actions.
