# 8. Towards Deep Learning Models

In this lecture we will dive deeper (pun intended) into non-shallow neural network optimization techniques. We will cover the following:

* __What is Stochastic Gradient Descent?__
* __How to build and train a neural network using PyTorch__
* __How to find the best hyperparameters: the GridSearch tool__
* __What are Adaptative Learning Rates?__
