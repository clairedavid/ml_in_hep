# Varying the Learning Rate

## Motivations
We saw in previous lectures that the Gradient Descent algorithm updates the parameters, or weights, in the form:
```{math}
:label: paramupdate
W_j \quad \leftarrow \quad W_j -\alpha \frac{\partial}{\partial W_j} J\left(\boldsymbol{W}\right) \;   \;   \;  \;   \;   \; \forall j \in [0..n]
```
````{margin}
Recall that the learning rate $\alpha$ is the hyperparameter defining the step size on the parameters at each update.
````
The learning rate $\alpha$ is kept constant through the whole process of Gradient Descent.

But we saw that the model's performance could be drastrically affected by the learning rate value; if too small the descent would take ages to converge, too big it could explode and not converge at all. How to properly choose this crucial hyperparameter?

In the florishing epoch (pun intended) of deep learning, new optimization techniques have emerged. The two most influencial families are __Learning Rate Schedulers__ and __Adaptative Learning Rates__. 

## Learning Rate Schedulers
````{prf:definition}
:label: learningratescheduledef
In a training procedure involving a learning rate, a __learning rate scheduler__ is a method consisting of modifying the learning rate at the beginning of each iteration. 

It uses a __schedule function__, which takes the current learning rate as input, along with a 'time' parameter linked with the increasing number of iterations, to output a new learning rate.

The updated learning rate is used in the optimizer.
````
Schedule refers to a timing; here it is the index number of the epoch, or iteration, that is incremented over time, i.e. the duration of the training.

```{important}
__What is the difference between epoch, batches and iteration?__

As we saw in Lecture 2 Section {ref}`warmup:linRegGD:gradientDescent`, an epoch is equivalent to the number of times the algorithm scans the entire data. It is a pass seeing the entire dataset. The batch size being the number of training samples, an iteration will be the number of batches needed to complete one epoch.
Example: if we have 1000 training samples splits in batches of size 250 each, then it will take 4 iterations to complete one epoch.
```

```{admonition} Question
:class: seealso
How should the learning rate vary? Should it increase? Decrease? Both?
```

Below are common learning schedules.

### Power Scheduling
The learning rate is modified according to:
````{margin}
The $t$ argument is the iteration integer, akin to a time yet the value are usually the iteration and/or epoch indices. 
````
```{math}
:label: powerscheduleeq
\alpha(t) = \frac{\alpha_0}{\left(1 + \frac{t}{s}\right)^c} \; ,
```
where $\alpha_0$ is the initial learning rate. The steps $s$ and power $c$ (usually 1) are hyperparameters. The learning rate drops at each step; e.g. after $s$ steps it is divided by 2 (assuming $c$ = 1).  

### Time-Based Decay Scheduling
The time-based learning rate scheduler is often the standard (e.g. the default implementation in Keras library). It is controlled by a decay parameter $d = \frac{\alpha_0}{N}$, where $N$ is the number of epochs. It is similar (a particular case even) to the power scheduling:
```{math}
:label: timebaseddecayeq
\alpha(t) = \alpha_0 \times \frac{1}{1 + d \times t} 
```
As compared to a linear decrease, time-based decay causes learning rate to decrease faster upon training start, and much slower later (see graph below).

### Exponential Decay Scheduling
The exponential decay is defined as:
```{math}
\alpha(t) = \alpha_0 \times 0.1^{-t/s} \; ,
```
which will get the learning rate to decrease faster upon training start, and much slower later.

### Step-based Decay Scheduling
Also called piecewise constant scheduling, this approach first uses of a constant learning rate for a given number of epochs and then the learning rate is reduced:
````{margin}
The floor function `floor(x)` or $\lfloor x \rfloor$ returns the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$.
````
```{math}
\alpha(t) = \alpha_0 \times e^{ \left \lfloor - \frac{t}{s} \right \rfloor }
```

## Adaptative Learning Rate 

An algorithm combining Stochastic Gradient Descent with a learning rate schedule would have been considered close to the state-of-the-art before... the arrival of much faster methods called adaptative optimizers. Instead of a separate scheduler, the optimization of the learning rate is directly embedded in the optimizer. These optimizers approximate the gradient using model internal feedback. In other words, they incorporate the history in the weight update. Huge advantage: they are almost parameter-free.

````{prf:definition}
:label: 
An __Adaptative Learning Rate__ refers to varying the learning rate using feedback from the model itself.
````
As the variation of the learning rate is done by the optimizer, adaptative learning rates and adaptative optimizers are equivalent terms.

Below are brief descriptions of the most popular adaptative optimizers.


### AdaGrad
This first adaptative algorithm was published in 2011. Compared to the classical Gradient Descent, AdaGrad points more directly toward the global optimum by decaying the learning rate more on the steepest dimension. 

```{figure} ../images/lec08_2_adagrad.png

```
In the figure above, the AdaGrad takes a more direct thus shorter path than Gradient Descent, as AdaGrad has its learning rate reduced in the direction of steepest descent. This is done by squaring each gradient component into a vector $\boldsymbol{s}$. The steepest a gradient component, the larger the square of this component $s_j$. The weights are updated in almost the same way as with Gradient Descent, yet each component is divided by $\boldsymbol{s} + \epsilon$. The added term $\epsilon$ is to prevent a division by zero (typically 10$^{-10}$). As a result, the algorithm detects how to change the learning rate dynamically and specifically on the large gradient components to adapt to their steep slope.

Mathematically: 
````{margin}
The $\otimes$ symbol is the element-wise multiplication, while the $\oslash$ is the element-wise division.
````
```{math}
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{s} \; &\leftarrow \; \boldsymbol{s}  \;+\;  \frac{\partial J\left(\boldsymbol{W}\right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{W}} \;\otimes \; \frac{\partial J\left(\boldsymbol{W}\right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{W}} \\[2ex]

\boldsymbol{W} \; &\leftarrow \; \boldsymbol{W} - \alpha \; \; \frac{\partial J\left(\boldsymbol{W}\right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{W}} \oslash \sqrt{\boldsymbol{s} + \epsilon}
\end{align*}
```
__The con__  
AdaGrad performs well on simple problem, like linear regression. With neural networks, it tends to stop too soon, before reaching the global minimum. Luckily, other adaptative algorithms fix this.

### RMSProp
RMSProp stands for Root Mean Square Propagation. It works the same as AdaGrad except that it keeps track of an exponentially decaying average of past squared gradients: 
```{math}
:label: rmspropeq
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{s} \; &\leftarrow \; \beta\boldsymbol{s}  \;+\;  (1 - \beta) \; \frac{\partial J\left(\boldsymbol{W}\right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{W}} \;\otimes \; \frac{\partial J\left(\boldsymbol{W}\right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{W}} \\[2ex]

\boldsymbol{W} \; &\leftarrow \; \boldsymbol{W} - \alpha \; \; \frac{\partial J\left(\boldsymbol{W}\right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{W}} \oslash \sqrt{\boldsymbol{s} + \epsilon}
\end{align*}
```
with the decay rate $\beta$, between 0 and 1, yet typically set to 0.9. One might ask: what is the point to introduce an extra hyparameter? It turns out the default value works well in most cases and does not require tuning. What the update in the expressions {eq}`rmspropeq` shows is a recursive way of computing a so-called Exponential Moving Average (EMA). In other words, $\beta$ acts as a constant smoothing factor, representing the degree of weighting increase. A lower $\beta$ discounts older observations faster. A higher $\beta$ gives more weight to the previous gradient, a bit less weight to the previous previous gradient, etc.

For more elaborated tasks than the simple linear case, RMSProp is robust. It was reigned until dethrowned by a newcomer called Adam. Before introducing Adam, let's first cover the notion of momentum optimization.

### Momentum Optimization
````{margin}
```{warning}
The algorithm name borrows the momentum concept from physics, yet it is a only metaphor. 
```
````
In physics, the momentum $\boldsymbol{p}$ is a vector obtained by taking the product of the mass and velocity of an object. It quantifies motion. In computing science, momentum refers to the direction and speed at which the parameters move - via iterative updates - through the parameter space. With momentum optimization, inertia is added to the system by updating the weights using the momenta from past iterations. This keeps the update in the same direction, preventing the infamous oscillations around the minimum with classic Gradient Descent. The common analogy is a ball rolling down an inclined plane. It will start slowly but soon "gain momentum", thus can go through flat gradient surface much faster than with the classic Gradient Descent. Therefore adding momentum considerably speeds the Gradient Descent process. Beside, it also helps roll beside local minimum.

The momentum optimization algorithm is as follow:
```{math}
\begin{align*}
\boldsymbol{m} \; &\leftarrow \; \beta \boldsymbol{m} \; - \; \alpha \; \; \frac{\partial J\left(\boldsymbol{W}\right)}{\partial \boldsymbol{W}} \\[2ex]

\boldsymbol{W} \; &\leftarrow \; \boldsymbol{W} + \boldsymbol{m} 
\end{align*}
```
Here the $\beta$ parameter controls the momentum from becoming too large.

There is no paper for RMSProp as the authors never published it! One of the authors Geoffrey Hinton presented it in Coursera. 
As a consequence, it is amusingly referenced by researchers as [slide 29 in lecture 6](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~tijmen/csc321/slides/lecture_slides_lec6.pdf)
