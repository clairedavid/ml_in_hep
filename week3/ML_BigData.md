# 13. Big Data & ML Strategies

Wether in the academic context or in industry, our world is getting more and more data about pretty much everything. Particle physics pioneered some aspects of big data back in the days. One could consider High Energy Physics as the precursor giving birth to big data, pushing the boundaries of technology and computer science. But this would not give justice to parallel developments in other fields of fundamental science, as well as innovations in data handling, storing and management. 

```{admonition} Anecdode from the author
During my Ph.D. I remember sending my code to the Worldwide LHC Grid, a custom network of dedicated servers that would fetch the nodes with the relevant LHC data and run my code on those machines. Reading the log files I could see my code had been run in tier centers in Europe, Taiwan, Western Canada... Why not downloading the data on my computer? Impossible: I would have needed 10,000 standard laptops! Such paradigm shift of shipping a code 'above' to a data center instead of working on a local machine gave rise to the so-called 'distributed computing' that eventually  

 to a server that uses so-called 'distributed computing' due to the impossibility to work purely locally (too much data) gave birth to the cloud technology.
