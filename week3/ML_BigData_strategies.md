# Strategies in Machine Learning

Reviewing the strategies for successfully implementing a machine learning project can be the topic of an entire book!
This section offers just a glimpse of the main tips 

===================

## Workflow
A reminder of what we detailed in Lecture 8 Section {ref}`DL:trainNN`, a machine learning project is generally following this workflow:

0. Frame the problem
1. Get the Data
1. Visualize the Data
1. Prepare the Data
1. Define the Model
1. Train the Model
1. Tune the Model
1. Evaluate the Model
1. Make Predictions






## Toolbox of the ML data scientist
Jupyter Notebook is excellent for pedagogical purposes. But what are professional machine learning experts using? 

 The following is by far not an exhaustive list, yet some tools that
