```{admonition} What is a flipped-classroom?
:class: note
A flipped-classroom is a pedagogical strategy consisting of reversing the traditional teaching scheme: instead of learning in class and practising at home, students are given material to study themselves beforehand and the in-class time is dedicated for debates, discussions and problem solving.
This approach gives more autonomy to the students, enhance self-learning skills and promote active participation and expression.

If you are curious and want to learn more, the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom) gives a good overview and describes some [examples of flipped-classroom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom#Examples) by field of study.
