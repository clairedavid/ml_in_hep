# Outlook

In the hope that those lectures convinced you that machine learning is more about math than magic, some of you may have fallen in love with an algorithm, or even the entire topic!

If you want to pursue either in academic circles or in industry, find below some links to help you further learn and enhance your machine learning skills.


## Learn
* [Coursera.org](https://data.nasdaq.com/): a global online learning platform that offers anyone, anywhere, access to online courses and degrees from leading universities and companies. Andrew Ng is the co-founder and instructor of the 
  * [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction)  |  3 months at 9 hours/week 
  * [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)  |  5 months at 8 hours/week

## Practice
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) has 50,000 public [datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) and 400,000 public [notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels) and is famous for its machine learning [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). CERN compiled a special dataset for the [Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/higgs-boson) and invited the [winners](https://atlas.cern/updates/news/machine-learning-wins-higgs-challenge) to present their results. 
* [DrivenData](https://www.drivendata.org/) works on projects at the intersection of data science and social impact, in areas like international development, health, education, research and conservation, and public services. 

## We Love Data
Some repository with data to play with:

* Africa: [opendataforafrica.org](https://dataportal.opendataforafrica.org/)
* The world: [dataportals.org](http://dataportals.org/) 
* Wikipedia: [List of datasets for machine-learning research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_datasets_for_machine-learning_research)
